# DiscordBot

Hi,
  
This is a discord bot I developed. I intergrated a neural network inside of it, currently I trained the neural network to play tic tac toe, but I am currently working on making it do a lot more fun and complex things such as chatbots and more complex games.

Feel free to use this but please make sure to give me credit

if you encounter any errors or have any feature requests/queries feel free to dm me on twitter or discord @HarryOC493#5941 or submit an issue

Usage:  
  You Need to install the requirements.txt using pip3  
  There is one script called train.py this script is used to train the neural net in case your not happy with the current training I have done you probably will as I have only trained it with epochs=100, batch_size=100 so it works but its pretty easy to beat
  There is another script called main.py this is the actual bot scipt, all you need to do is run this script on a machine connected to the internet and is capable
  of running a neural net.
  Inside of the sciript there is a line of code called "client.run('123456xxx')" in this line you need to pase your bot token between the ' '
  Besides this its fairly self-explanatory
